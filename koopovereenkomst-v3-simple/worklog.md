# Worklog

First set up a clean and tiny [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [ReactJS]() App by following the [Next.js Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs). This included the [extended step](https://nextjs.org/learn/excel/typescript) to make use of TypeScript. This is the first commit for this version.

Next is adding [Solid UI React](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-ui-react) and see how to get this working and connecting to a Solid POD.
